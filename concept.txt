2009 by ryan dahl(he was the first man who run javascript in browser )
ui/ux can run on server (Due to virtual dom concept in react its all Dom cannot be reflected in internet it make search engine
cannot recognize it)
so for development we need nodejs
before nodejs javascript is for client side only 

we start form what is not nodejs ??
nodejs is not a framework.
nodejs is runtime enviroment for javascript
serversite javascript is nodejs

we need serversite layer to communicate with data

serversite programing
1. Database communication
2. serversite (use of ram)
   how much processing power we will use
   cpu can configure by us
process,, thread
 (these all are related to our operating system)

In order to communicate with (file to file communications)
it is basically  concept of module

# # we need protocol to communicate between two programming
HTTP,,TCP protocol

# # const net =require ('net')
encryption related things 
  1. crypto module used
# # child processed (operating system ko kuro)


Version checks
node --Version
npm --Version
npx --Version
After installation of node these all are reflected in terminal

# # Node js kasari kam garxa vanne kura xaii Events module bata clear hunxa

ja ko packAge manage garne kam npm
npm init
packAge.json --> it holds the overall information about project
packAgelock.json --> Dependences ko version lock garne kam garxa
nodemodules --> Downloaded packages are stored in node modules.
Dependencies --> this section will hold the entire information about Dependences

Dev Dependencies --> Only used for development purpose

if we found tilde operation in version (~13.2.0) yo use garda vetiyo vane  yeii version linxa vetiyena vane 
yesko Ori pari ka version laii line vayo (but latest xaiii lidaina)

yedi naya install garna paryo vane suru bataii install garna parxa
